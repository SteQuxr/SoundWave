Sound Cloud and spotify clone school project

A lot of stuff has been done inefficiently, by that I mean code repeats instead of a single file etc.

Songs are saved in images folder (I forgor to change)

Half of the database are tables that aren't used because I didn't have time to complete it.

Didn't know how to host at the time so It's on xampp localhost.

Maybe I'll come back to this one day and actually make it good.
