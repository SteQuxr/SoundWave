Sound Cloud and spotify clone school project

A lot of stuff has been done inefficiently, by that I mean code repeats instead of a single file etc.

Songs are saved in images folder (I forgor to change)

Half of the database are tables that aren't used because I didn't have time to complete it.

Maybe I'll come back to this one day and actually make it good.
